# लेखन (Lekhan)

**लेखन (Lekhan)** is a modern, web-based programming environment that allows users to write logic using the Marathi language. It is a just a concept designed to demonstrate the power of Marathi in the world of software engineering. It moves beyond simple translation to explore a native-first logic system, where the syntax feels as natural as spoken words.

## The Transpilation Engine (Marathi to JS)
Instead of building a full-scale compiler from scratch, Lekhan uses a Transpiler approach. This works through a series of complex Regular Expressions (Regex) that scan the Marathi text for specific keywords and map them to their JavaScript equivalents:

String Preservation: Before any translation happens, the engine identifies and "hides" text inside quotes (like "नमस्कार") so that words inside the strings aren't accidentally converted into code.

**● Keyword Mapping**: It replaces Marathi commands with JavaScript syntax (e.g., छापा becomes console.log, and चल becomes let).

**● Logic Reconstruction**: It handles structural elements like functions (कार्य), loops (साठी), and conditionals (जर...अन्यथा).

**● Semicolon Insertion**: Since Marathi doesn't naturally use semicolons, a custom post-processing function adds them to the generated JavaScript to ensure the code is valid for execution.

##  Why Lekhan?

We believe that **Digital Sovereignty** begins with language. By removing the English language barrier, we empower students and creators from every corner of Maharashtra to master logic and computer science in their mother tongue. **Lekhan** (Writing) represents the power of creation through our own words.
